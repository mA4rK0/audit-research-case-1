# Welcome to my first smart contract audit & research ðŸ‘‹

this is my first audit report after learning some basic skills to do audit. I was auditing the PasswordStore protocol to save & retrieve a password from the owner of this protocol. Audit with Foundry framework.

## About Research Protocol :

PasswordStore is a protocol for storage and retrieval of a user's passwords. used by a single user, not designed for multiple users. Only the owner should be able to set and access this password.
